The Google Maps Team is visiting Berlin

#### #CodeTheRoad supports DevFest Berlin

To celebrate 10 years of Google Maps, the team is hitting the road to meet with developers and creators who are building the new map of today.

Maps have transformed the way we use technology. They connect us, elevate our curiosity, and give us freedom to explore, share and access what’s around us. Google Maps has been at the forefront of bringing simple, useful, and comprehensive maps to billions of users. But it’s developers who are the real force behind today’s massive adoption of maps.
