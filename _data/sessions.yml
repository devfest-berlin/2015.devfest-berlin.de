  description: "Lots of myths surrounded and still surround the search rankings of fully dynamic web apps since their introduction. We took the bet of building an AngularJS web app that did not make tradeoffs on either speed, usability and a strong SEO channel - show how we did it, and which problems came up. We didn't just achieve our goals, but in some ways could even leverage opportunities that would not have been possible with a classic web page. We'll also present how we went on from there to create one of the most performant current hybrid mobile apps from the very same code base."

  title: "Unit testing Android apps"
  description: "There's no doubt that test automation is a way to go when working on large projects. But a lot of Android developers struggle with writing unit or integration tests on Android. The goal of the talk is to share a simple and practical approach to starting developing with unit tests. While Android framework is indeed not as test friendly as we all want, developers still can achieve decent test coverage. To do so, one should apply some of these techniques: 1. Using Model-View-Presenter pattern. MVP allows to separate business logic and use cases from view logic.  2. Inversion of Control(IoC) makes it easy to keep track of dependencies, which is a key for unit-testing.  3. Building abstraction layers for such components as Services and BroadcastReceivers allows to encapsulate business logic, which eliminates overhead of writing unit tests. 4. Dealing with legacy code is possible by leveraging such techniques as anticorruption layer."

  title: "Reactive UI on Android with Scala"
  description: "Reactive programming can bring many benefits to mobile application development, especially when implementing UI. User interfaces developed this way are naturally responsive and code tends to be much more concise, which leads to easier development and less bugs. Reactive Extensions became quite popular among Android developers recently,  unfortunately creating UI with this library tends to be very unnatural, partially due to Java language limitations. Using Scala and techniques borrowed from Functional Reactive Programming we can achieve much better results. This talk is not going to be about Scala itself, nor about using Scala on Android. This talk is going to show how we can use Scala to implement UI in reactive fashion, achieving better results, with less code. There will be quite a lot of Scala code, but it should be accessible for Java developers."

  title: "Form of Art"
  description: "Although creating forms is an easy task, especially with AngularJS, creating user-friendly forms with powerful capabilities requires creativity and attention to details. AngularJS form, input and ngModel directives have various options we should exploit. Other modules and directives, whether shipped with AngularJS or written independently, vastly expand our toolbox and allow us to easily upgrade our forms' usability and visibility. The first part of this talk will be live-coding of a form from scratch. We will go over the basic best practices: form structure, submission, and validation. We will discover important relationships between directives, such as ngModelOptions and ngSubmit. In the second part I will show how I used third-party directives to add abilities to forms and controls, enhancing the form usability and user experience, in real-life projects."
