  description: "Containers are rapidly changing the way we develop applications and services but to release their full potential you'll need to find simple and efficient ways to manage them and wire them together. In this session we'll look at the key concepts behind Kubernetes container orchestration platform. We'll see how it can simply and efficiently handle the management of your existing container based apps and we'll show you how you can use it to build new applications from scratch."

  description: "With Prometheus, you are in a good position to monitor your ever growing clusters and the skyrocketing number of your microservices. However, you need to master its advanced features: Find monitoring targets with service discovery. Shard and federate Prometheus servers for scalability. Monitor on all levels: hosts, containers, and services. Instrument your code and create dashboards and alerts in a meaningful way that allows you to identify and solve issues even in very complex scenarios. While doing all of this, you will notice the natural match between Kubernetes and Prometheus."

  title: "We can't use Angular. It will hurt our SEO."
  description: "Lots of myths surrounded and still surround the search rankings of fully dynamic web apps since their introduction. We took the bet of building an AngularJS web app that did not make tradeoffs on either speed, usability and a strong SEO channel - show how we did it, and which problems came up. We didn't just achieve our goals, but in some ways could even leverage opportunities that would not have been possible with a classic web page. We'll also present how we went on from there to create one of the most performant current hybrid mobile apps from the very same code base."

  title: "Unit testing Android apps"
  description: "There's no doubt that test automation is a way to go when working on large projects. But a lot of Android developers struggle with writing unit or integration tests on Android. The goal of the talk is to share a simple and practical approach to starting developing with unit tests. While Android framework is indeed not as test friendly as we all want, developers still can achieve decent test coverage. To do so, one should apply some of these techniques: 1. Using Model-View-Presenter pattern. MVP allows to separate business logic and use cases from view logic.  2. Inversion of Control(IoC) makes it easy to keep track of dependencies, which is a key for unit-testing.  3. Building abstraction layers for such components as Services and BroadcastReceivers allows to encapsulate business logic, which eliminates overhead of writing unit tests. 4. Dealing with legacy code is possible by leveraging such techniques as anticorruption layer."

  title: "Reactive UI on Android with Scala"
  description: "Reactive programming can bring many benefits to mobile application development, especially when implementing UI. User interfaces developed this way are naturally responsive and code tends to be much more concise, which leads to easier development and less bugs. Reactive Extensions became quite popular among Android developers recently,  unfortunately creating UI with this library tends to be very unnatural, partially due to Java language limitations. Using Scala and techniques borrowed from Functional Reactive Programming we can achieve much better results. This talk is not going to be about Scala itself, nor about using Scala on Android. This talk is going to show how we can use Scala to implement UI in reactive fashion, achieving better results, with less code. There will be quite a lot of Scala code, but it should be accessible for Java developers."
