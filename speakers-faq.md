__Speakers information.__


If you are reading these rows you are most likely one of our speakers for DevFest Berlin 2015. If you are not then maybe
next time you will be :) .

As we've received a few (similar) questions we've decided to have this list of questions and answers that could help you
to add the final touches to your talk:

- The resolution of the projector/screen?
Every projector should be usable with 16:9 (but just in case have a 1024x768 version available).
We definitely recommend you having a good contrast, preferably black text on white background sample slides as those
should be looking ok (again, as a backup).

- The rough size of the expected audience?
We expect to have about 100 attendees per room / with a total of about 300 attendees for the whole event.

- Do I need to supply slides in advance?
We highly encourage to send them as PRs to us here: [https://github.com/devfest-berlin/slides](https://github.com/devfest-berlin/slides/) This way everyone can have
access to them as soon as the conference starts and we have a backup of your talk.

- Can I use my own computer to present?
Ideally yes but we'll try to have a backup available.

- Do I need to supply my own adapter/presenter remote etc?
Every connector should have HDMI/ VGA connectors. Please try to bring your own adapter (and don't forget to charge your
laptop / bring a power adapter). Unfortunately we don't have a presenter remote available so bring your own if you have one.

- Do you have any hard limits for length/Q and A time etc
To allow our attendees enough time for a break and switch rooms we planned all talks to end after 45 mins - this includes
the Q&A. Ending a talk a little early (~30 mins) won't be a problem as there will just more time for questions and break.

- Can I bring some of my companyâ€™s swag to hand out/distribute at the conference?
No, so please don't do it. Of course, your company can always become a sponsor and then you'll be allowed to do so.
We can send your company an email with a presentation about becoming a sponsor if you'll provide us an e-mail to send it to.

- Do you have support for microphone / audio?
Yes, every room is equipped with a professional sound system with wireless microphones. If your presentation requires
audio support please get in touch with us so we can test the setup beforehand.

- Will the talks be recorded?
Yes, we plan to have a video camera setup for every stage. (If this will work out) The talks will be recorded and published
on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DevFestBerlin) under the [CC BY SA 4.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).


We would also kindly ask you to send us a few details about your talk (if you haven't done so already):

- the intended level
- the takeaway

If there are any further questions that we could help you out with, please let us know.

Looking forward for your talk!
