__This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. [Read full version](https://github.com/devfest-berlin/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).__


The GDGs of Berlin and DevFest Berlin pride themselves on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at GDG meetings. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing porn in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop. Continuous jerky behavior may result in getting expelled from the meeting or GDG Chapter.

If someone is bothering you, please tell GDG Organizers immediately and they will take care of it. We want to maintain GDG DevFest’s awesomeness.
